Lately, I’ve been noticing a buzz around RAG — Retrieval-Augmented Generation — everywhere I look. LinkedIn posts, YouTube tutorials, blog articles...everyone seems to be talking about it. But here's the thing — most of what I’ve come across barely scratches the surface. No one talks about how to make RAG better, how to improve RAG performance, or how to optimize RAGs. They all seem to stick to the basics: retrieval and generation. Some go a little deeper, touching on indexing and reranking, but they never seem to dig into the real depth of RAG, like how different embedding techniques influence performance.

That got me curious. I wanted to go beyond the basics — to really understand what makes RAG powerful and how we could leverage it. So I started reading, experimenting, and learning. And now, I've decided to share what I’ve discovered in this blog series.

## Why This Series?

This series is my attempt to explore RAG beyond the surface. I want to take us through starting from basics to advanced RAG architectures — Query translation, Routing methods, Query Construction methods like Text to SQL, Text to Graph using Cypher, Text to Vector DB, Multi-Representation Indexing, and Retrieval — and break down how each of them works. I’ll try to cover each topic in-depth, starting from Multi-Query, RAG Fusion techniques, Semantic Routing, different Indexing methods, Re-retrieval techniques, Re-generation, and Feedback Generation (self-RAG).

If you’ve been wondering what makes RAG truly powerful or how you can build state-of-the-art RAG solutions, this series is for you. Let’s move beyond the basics together and unlock the full potential of Retrieval-Augmented Generation.

## What is RAG?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a method that makes large language models (LLMs) smarter by giving them access to extra information. It works by finding the most useful documents or data for a question and showing them to the LLM, helping it give better answers. This approach is great for chatbots and Q&A systems that need up-to-date facts or expert knowledge.

## Code Example

```python
from langchain.load import dumps, loads
from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from operator import itemgetter

# RAG-Fusion
template = """You are a helpful assistant that generates multiple search queries based on a single input query. 
Generate multiple search queries related to: {question} 
Output (4 queries):"""
prompt_rag_fusion = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(template)

generate_queries = (
    prompt_rag_fusion 
    | ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)
    | StrOutputParser() 
    | (lambda x: x.split("\n"))
)

def reciprocal_rank_fusion(results: list[list], k=60):
    fused_scores = {}

    for docs in results:
        for rank, doc in enumerate(docs):
            doc_str = dumps(doc)
            if doc_str not in fused_scores:
                fused_scores[doc_str] = 0
            fused_scores[doc_str] += 1 / (rank + k)

    reranked_results = [
        (loads(doc), score)
        for doc, score in sorted(fused_scores.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    ]

    return reranked_results

retrieval_chain_rag_fusion = generate_queries | retriever.map() | reciprocal_rank_fusion
docs = retrieval_chain_rag_fusion.invoke({"question": question})
len(docs)

template = """Answer the following question based on this context:

{context}

Question: {question}"""
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(template)

final_rag_chain = (
    {"context": retrieval_chain_rag_fusion, 
     "question": itemgetter("question")} 
    | prompt
    | llm
    | StrOutputParser()
)

final_rag_chain.invoke({"question":question})
```
